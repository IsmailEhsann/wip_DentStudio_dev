                    <p>Hi, I’m Karanjeet, a dental graduate with a passion for oral surgery and implants, and an expert in helping dental practices grow. With my background in marketing, SEO, and business management, I’ve made it my mission to help dental professionals not only succeed but thrive in an increasingly competitive landscape.</p>
                    <!-- <p>As the co-founder of DenStudio, I work closely with dental business owners to unlock their full potential—whether that’s by driving more patients through the door, streamlining their workflows for better efficiency, or building a brand that resonates. I believe that every dental practice can stand out, and I specialize in crafting personalized marketing strategies and optimizing day-to-day operations that allow dentists to focus on what they do best: providing exceptional care.</p>
                    <p>I’ve had the privilege of serving as the President of Leeds Dental Aesthetics and as an ambassador for Orascoptic, roles that have given me deep insight into the cutting-edge technology and techniques shaping modern dentistry. I’m also an active member of communities like DIAN and Dentinal Tubules, always staying ahead of trends to help my clients innovate and lead in the industry.</p>
                    <p>In addition to my clinical experience, I bring technical skills in website development (HTML & CSS) and 3D scanning technology, which allows me to assist practices in optimizing their workflows and improving patient outcomes. By integrating these technologies, I help practices save time, reduce costs, and enhance the patient experience.</p>
                    <p>Beyond my professional goals, I’m deeply committed to making a difference. I’m on a mission to open a charity that provides essential dental care to less fortunate individuals. I believe everyone deserves access to quality dental treatment, and I aim to give back by creating a platform where we can make life-changing care accessible to those in need.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, my goal is to help dental practice owners take their business to the next level—whether that’s through growth, efficiency, or innovation—and one day, open my own practice that reflects my passion for both dentistry and giving back to the community.</p> -->
